# p5play template

This p5play-template folder contains a basic p5play project.

`favicon.png` - The icon for the web page, which appears on the browser tab.
`index.html` - Gets the latest version of p5play and runs your sketch.
`sketch.js` - Write your code here! Starter code is provided.

Use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) Visual Studio Code extension to run your project in a web browser. Click "Go Live" in the bottom right corner of Visual Studio Code to start the server.

If you want to work on p5play projects offline, then use the offline links in the `index.html` file. You can also choose to use p5play with p5.js, which is more beginner friendly, or q5.js, which is faster.

To keep p5play updated for offline use, install [bun](https://bun.sh/) or [npm](https://nodejs.org). Then in the file menu hover over "Terminal" and select "New Terminal". In your p5play project folder run `bun up` or `npm up` to update p5play to the latest version.

You can delete the contents of this file and write your own README describing your project.
